<H4><A NAME="TOC62">Why does my .if command not work?</A></H4>
<P>Even without looking, I'm sure you're trying something like
.if $(var) = Xyz. Well, this won't work.  Htmlpp is lazy, and
sends all its .if commands to Perl to evaluate.  Perl thinks
that '=' is an assignment, not a comparison.  Which always works,
or perhaps never does, but certainly will not change depending
on the value of $(var). To cut a long story short, use 'eq' and
buy the Camel Book.

<H4><A NAME="TOC63">Why does my .if command still not work?</A></H4>
<P>Well, maybe you made a mistake.  For example, this is wrong:
<PRE>if $(TITLE) eq "first second"
</PRE>
You have to enclose both arguments in quotes, like this:
<PRE>if "$(TITLE)" eq "first second"
</PRE>

<H4><A NAME="TOC64">How do I install htmlpp on UNIX?</A></H4>
<P>Put it into a common directory like /usr/local/bin; make htmlpp
executable (chmod +x htmlpp); make sure its .i and .pl files are
in the same place; put this directory on the PERLLIB path, and put
it on your PATH too.  That should work.  If you don't have access
to /usr/local/bin (i.e. you're not root, which if you were you'd
probably not need help at this point) then make a bin directory
under your login directory and add $HOME/bin to your path.

<H4><A NAME="TOC65">How do I change the .htm extension to .html?</A></H4>
<P>Redefine the $(EXT) variable.

<H4><A NAME="TOC66">Do you know of any good link checkers?</A></H4>
